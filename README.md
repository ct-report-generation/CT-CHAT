# CT-CHAT

Welcome to the official repository for **CT-CHAT**, a cutting-edge visual-language foundation model designed specifically for 3D chest CT volumes. CT-CHAT provides an open-source codebase and pre-trained models, utilizing [CT-CLIP](https://github.com/ibrahimethemhamamci/CT-CLIP) and a VQA (Visual Question Answering) dataset adapted from [CT-RATE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibrahimhamamci/CT-RATE), making it accessible to researchers worldwide. The VQA dataset and model weights are available via the [HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibrahimhamamci/CT-RATE).

## System Requirements

Before you get started, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- **Python version**: > 3.12.4
- **Necessary dependencies**: Install CT-CLIPâ€™s dependencies by following the instructions in the [CT-CLIP repository](https://github.com/ibrahimethemhamamci/CT-CLIP).
- **Additional libraries**: Ensure that the following libraries are installed:
  - PyTorch v2.4.0
  - CUDA v12.4
  - SciPy v1.14.0
  - Torchvision v0.19.0
  - Scikit-learn v1.2.2
  - Pandas v2.2.2
  - Transformers v4.44.0
  - NumPy v1.26.4

### Hardware Requirements

- **For training**: 
  - Small models: Minimum of 2 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM.
  - Large models (80B Llama 3.1): Minimum of 4 A100 GPUs.
  
- **For inference**: 
  - Large models: At least 2 A100 GPUs.
  - Smaller models: 1 A100 GPU.

## Training

To train the model, follow the provided scripts. It's crucial to run the training data through the image encoder to generate embeddings prior to training. Use the provided [Encoder Script](https://github.com/ibrahimethemhamamci/CT-CHAT/blob/main/llava/serve/encode_script.py) as a reference for encoding a single image. Note that this differs from the latent-saving process in CT-CLIP; the outputs must be saved before latent projection. Update the training scripts with the correct path to the saved encodings and other necessary configurations.

## Inference

For inference, refer to the [serve scripts](llava/serve). To perform CLI-based inference, the validation data must first be encoded similarly to the training data. After encoding, adjust the required paths in the CT-CHAT validation scripts for CLI inference.

For GUI-based inference, run the following commands:

```bash
python -m llava.serve.controller --host 0.0.0.0 --port 10000
python -m llava.serve.gradio_web_server --controller http://localhost:10000 --model-list-mode reload
python -m llava.serve.model_worker --host 0.0.0.0 --controller http://localhost:10000 --port 40000 --worker http://localhost:40000 --model-path "path_to_model" --model-base "path_to_model"
```

## Pretrained Models

We offer pre-trained models for several LLMs, trained on the VQA dataset described in our paper. You can download them from the links below:

- **CT-CHAT Mistral**: [Download Here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibrahimhamamci/CT-RATE)

## VQA Dataset

The VQA dataset has been derived from the CT-RATE data using the Llama 3.1 80B model with the scripts provided [here](./VQA_dataset). Short-answer questions have been sampled from the [RadGenome Chest CT dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/RadGenome/RadGenome-ChestCT). The dataset is available in the [CT-RATE HuggingFace repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ibrahimhamamci/CT-RATE).
